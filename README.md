# Xray-cmd

scripts for Xray. Since V2rayU on mac has stopped updating, it seems that it's function of checking for v2ray-core updates is also not working well, and since I didn't find a better alternative for the time being, I wrote a script to update Xray core manually.

Xray 相关的脚本。自从 mac 上的 V2rayU 停止了更新，似乎它检查 v2ray-core 更新的功能也不好使了，由于暂时还没找到更好的替代品，就自己写个脚本来更新 Xray 吧。
